# Super-Resolution with SRCNN

This project demonstrates Super-Resolution using a pre-trained SRCNN (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network) model. The goal is to enhance the resolution of a low-resolution image to produce a higher-resolution output.

## Project Structure

- `srcnn_model.h5`: This file contains a pre-trained SRCNN model. For demonstration purposes, a dummy model is created and saved locally, which can be replaced with a more robust trained model for better results.
- `low_res_image.jpg`: A sample low-resolution image that will be used as input for the super-resolution process.
- `high_resolution_image.jpg`: The output image generated by the super-resolution model.

## Setup and Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies** (if not already installed in your environment):
    ```bash
    !pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python Pillow
    ```

2.  **Create and Save the SRCNN Model (or download a pre-trained one)**:
    A dummy SRCNN model is created and saved as `/content/srcnn_model.h5`. This model is untrained and serves only to demonstrate the workflow. For actual super-resolution quality, you would need to train this model or use a properly pre-trained model.

3.  **Download a Sample Low-Resolution Image**:
    A sample image (`low_res_image.jpg`) is downloaded from a public source.

4.  **Perform Super-Resolution**:
    The core super-resolution logic is performed by loading the model and the low-resolution image, preprocessing the image, making a prediction with the model, and then post-processing and displaying the high-resolution output.

## Notes

- The SRCNN model used here is a simple architecture for demonstration. For state-of-the-art super-resolution, consider using more advanced models like ESRGAN, EDSR, or others available on TensorFlow Hub.
- The `Image.BICUBIC` interpolation is used for resizing, which is a common practice for super-resolution pre-processing.
- The output image quality heavily depends on the training of the SRCNN model. The dummy model provided here is untrained.
